# Skycutter

This is a utility to allow us to use [Rosie Pattern Language](https://gitlab.com/rosie-pattern-language/rosie) in conjunction with Elixir.  The idea is to allow multiple instances of Rosie to run in order to search logs and to use Elixir to control the multiple instances. 

## The Name

I have never been very good at coming up with names but at this point in history it wasn't hard to come up with one.  I've been a fan of domesticated pigeons most of my life and the [Ukranian Skycutter](https://www.roysfarm.com/ukrainian-skycutter-pigeon/) is a breed I've heard quite a bit about.  This name is just a small way of expressing my admiration for the brave people of the Ukraine.
